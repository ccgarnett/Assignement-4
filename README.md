Project Description
I chose to work with a simple D-flip-flop to get comfortable with the basics. I built a small Finite State Machine (FSM) and focused on understanding how the circuit moves between states step by step. It was a great way to start small and build confidence.

Solution
I set up the FSM so that a 1 moves it to the next state, and a 0 keeps it in the same state. Using a D-flip-flop and some basic logic, I tested it with different inputs and saw how the states changed. It was simple but really helped me see how the circuit works.

Reflection
I discovered that I really like FSM diagramsâ€”they make it easier to visualize how circuits behave. Breaking things down into small steps helped me learn better, and it made me feel more confident about tackling bigger projects. This was a fun way to get started!
